/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for QuizMasterAI.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and quizzes.
 * Quiz attempts are stored in a root collection to allow creators to view results, secured by checking the quiz's authorId.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /users/{userId}/quizzes/{quizId}: Quizzes created by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/quiz_attempts/{quizAttemptId}: A user's own history of attempts.
 * - /quiz_attempts/{quizAttemptId}: Root collection for all attempts, used for creator dashboards.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Write operations are protected by an authorization check.
 * - Quiz creators can read attempts for their own quizzes from the root collection.
 * - Users can read and write to their own private attempt history.
