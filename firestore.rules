/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for QuizMasterAI.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles, quizzes, quiz questions, and quiz attempts.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, providing path-based ownership. Authorization decisions are based on the authenticated user's ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /users/{userId}/quizzes/{quizId}: Quizzes created by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/quizzes/{quizId}/questions/{questionId}: Questions within a user's quiz.
 * - /users/{userId}/quiz_attempts/{quizAttemptId}: Quiz attempts made by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - All write operations are protected by an authorization check.
 * - Data consistency is enforced between the path and the document's internal fields.
 * - Denormalization is used to simplify and optimize authorization checks. The `authorId` field in the `Quiz` document allows quick verification of ownership without additional reads.
